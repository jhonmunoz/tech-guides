# [Wolox](https://wolox.co) Tech Guides and Standards

At [Wolox](https://wolox.co), we are a big team of passionate developers that love building apps with cutting-edge technologies and the best standards and practices to insurance code quality and maintenance. In this repository, you will find the code standards we chose for those main frameworks, languages, and technologies we use. You will also find some other information such as useful documentation, scripts we usually need and our posts for our [engineering blog](http://eng.wolox.co)
